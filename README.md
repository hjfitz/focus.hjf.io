[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1ff4a001-d275-4c5f-b874-66bde38fc5f6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/brave-payne-beb9d4/deploys)

A quick webapp to repeat youtube videos once they're stopped. Might end up with a pomo timer.

Great for working with a poor attention span.

## Development

This uses no build-tools (once I've removed them). Open `index.html` in your browser and get coding!

## Deployment

- [focus.hjf.io](https://focus.hjf.io)
- Due to no build tools, builds are lightning fast.

## Features

- Repeats a video innit
- 25 minute pomo timer
- Click a link to start playing (should add data-url to li tags)
- Pause music at end of pomo
- Soon: Show running timer on the page
